# diff_correct

The aim of ```diff_correct()``` is to provide an alternative to ```cna::is.submodel()``` for checking that
two models are compatible in the sense that they entail no contradictory claims about difference-making relations.
`diff_correct()` judges two models as compatible as long as this condition is satisfied, even if the candidate model differs from the target in that the former omits some mediating causes that are present in the target model.

TO DO

- test
- add INUS check
- if not broken, generalize to csf candidates
